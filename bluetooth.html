  <h1>What is Bluetooth?</h1>
  <div class="definition">
    <p>Bluetooth is a wireless personal area network technology that allows devices to communicate with each other over short distances, typically within a range of 30 feet (10 meters).</p>
    <p>Bluetooth uses radio waves to transmit data between devices, and operates on the 2.4 GHz frequency band.</p>
  </div>
  <marquee class="marquee" direction="left" scrollamount="5">Bluetooth is used in a wide range of devices, including headphones, speakers, smartphones, and laptops!</marquee>
  <h2>A Brief History of Bluetooth</h2>
  <div class="history">
    <p>Bluetooth was invented in 1994 by a team of engineers at Intel, led by Jaap Haartsen and Sven Mattison.</p>
    <p>The technology was named after a 10th-century Danish king, Harald Bl√•tand (Harold Bluetooth), who united warring factions in Denmark.</p>
    <p>The first Bluetooth device was released in 1998, and the technology has since become widely adopted in consumer electronics.</p>

  <h2>How Bluetooth Works</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Devices with Bluetooth capabilities have a small radio transmitter and receiver.</li>
    <li>When a device is turned on, it begins to broadcast a unique identifier, called a MAC address.</li>
    <li>Other devices in range can detect the broadcast and initiate a connection.</li>
    <li>Data is transmitted between devices using a technique called frequency hopping spread spectrum.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Advantages of Bluetooth</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Wireless connectivity eliminates the need for cables.</li>
    <li>Bluetooth devices are often low-power and low-cost.</li>
    <li>The technology is widely supported by many devices and operating systems.</li>
  </ul>
